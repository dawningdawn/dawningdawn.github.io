# 1. Introduction
* How should we reply to the question, ‘can machines think?’
* The following is the first paragraph of Alan Turing’s canonical paper <I.—Computing Machinery and Intelligence>(1950), that contains the very question.
> I PROPOSE to consider the question, ‘Can machines think?’ This should begin with definitions of the meaning of the terms ‘machine’ and ‘think’. The definitions might be framed so as to reflect so far as possible the normal use of the words, but this attitude is dangerous. If the meaning of the words ‘machine’ and ‘think’ are to be found by examining how they are commonly used it is difficult to escape the conclusion that the meaning and the answer to the question, ‘Can machines think?’ is to be sought in a statistical survey such as a Gallup poll. But this is absurd. Instead of attempting such a definition I shall replace the question by another, which is closely related to it and is expressed in relatively unambiguous words.
I have summarized the paragraph as following.
* Can machines think?
  * What is the definitions of the meaning of the terms 'machine' and 'think'?
    * In order to answer a question, one has to define the meaning of the terms it contains. (Principle of compostionality)
      * How should one define the meaning of the terms 'machine' and 'think?'
        * It is is nonsensical to define the meaning of the terms by how they are commonly used, as in a statistical survey.
          * Let's replace the question 'Can machines think?' with a game.
<br>I think that 5th part of his argument is debatable. In fact, the current paradigm in machine learning is based on the conjecture that intelligent beings learn new things by statistics.
