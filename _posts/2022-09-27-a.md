* The question I want to address is this: 
<br>If the universe is a giant machine operating on a set of rules, what are the subset of rules that gave birth to life? 
<br>How are those rulese related to the laws of physics? 
<br>What is the most fundamental, all-encompassing rule that perpetuates every event in this universe?
<br/><br/>
  &#8734;
<br/><br/>
* In the beginning, there was the **initial singularity** -- a hot, dense state that contained all the energy and **spacetime** of the Universe. 
  
  <small>**Initial Singularity**: "A singularity predicted by some models of the Big Bang theory to have existed before the Big Bang." [1] 
  <br>Usually, singularity refers to a condition where gravity is so strong that spacetime breaks down. (However, note that singularity is still poorly-defined, even according to the current best theory of gravity, the theory of general relativity.) 
  <br>General relativity predicts that any object that goes through gravitational collapse beyond a certain point, forms a black hole inside which singularity is formed. 
  <br>However, initial singularity did not collapse into a black hole, because the spacetime was rapidly expanding. 
  (Currently-known density limits for gravitational collapse are based on objects of relatively constant size in time.)</small>
  
  <small>**Spacetime**: A four-dimensional manifold that has the three dimensions of space and one dimension of time. It’s essentially a differentiable manifold with a pseudo-Riemannian metric. Unlike energy that can be tranformed into matter, spacetime is not a physical object, but a mathematical model. (This does not mean it is not _real_.)</small>

# The First 20 Minutes

* Then an _**event**_ happended that triggered the expansion of our initial singularity. Big Bang! 
* Immediately after the bang followed the **Plank epoch** (0s ~ 10<sup>-43</sup>s). 
* Back then, the gravitational force and the unified force (electromagnetic force, weak force, strong force) were all one.
* As our baby universe expands, it cools.

  <small>_**An event?**_: It is all a conjecture, but the appearance of WIMPS(Weakly Interacting Massive Particles) or dark matter & dark energy could have triggered the expansion of the initial singularity.</small>
  
  <small>**Plank epoch**: Named after the Plank time (t<sub>p</sub>), which is from zero to approximately 10<sup>-43</sup> seconds. We do not know yet what physical theories apply to this time scale. Back then, physical quantities like temperature and energies were in the range of Plank units values, and they were so high that subatomic particles could not form & the four fundamental forces were one. For more information on Plank units, see [here](https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/p/Planck+Units).</small>
  
  <small>Before we move on any further, let's inform ourselves thoroughly of the standard model.

  <small>**The standard model of particle physics** is a theory that describes 3 of the 4 known fundamental forces (electromagnetic, weak, and strong forces) and classifies all known elementary particles.
  <br>Elementary particles are classified into two categories: **elementary fermions** and **elementary bosons**.</small> 
  
  <small>A **fermion** is a particle that obeys the Fermi-Dirac statistics. F-D statistics is a type of quantum statistics that applies to the physics of a system comprised of many non-interacting, identical particles that obey the Pauli exclusion principle. A fermion has a half-odd-interger spin. ex. spin 1/2, 3/2, 5/2.
      <br>* **Quarks** (spin 1/2) are funndamental constituents of matter. Quarks combine to form composite particles called hadrons, of which the most stable onese are protons and neutrons that make up atomic nuclei. Another example of hadron is a baryon, which contains an odd number of quarks. Quarks are never alone -- they are always found within hadrons.
      <br>* **Leptons** (spin 1/2) are elementary particles that do not undergo strong interactions.</small>
  
  <small>A **boson** is a particle that obeys the Bose-Einstein statistics. B-E statistics is a type of quantum statistics that applies to the physics of a system comprised of many non-interacting, indistinguishable particles that do not follow the Pauli exclusion principle unlike fermions. It describes how they may occupy a set of availabe discrete energy states at thermodynamic equilibrium. A boson has an integer spin. ex. spin 0, 1, 2.
      <br>* **Gauge bosons** (spin 1) are force carriers that mediate the strong, weak, and electromagnetic fundamental interactions. When a force-mediating particle is exchanged, that is when we say "a force has infleunced both of them." Becasue they are bosons that have spin 1, and they do not follow the Pauli exclusion principle that limit fermions. Hence they do not have a theoretical limit on their spatial density.
      <br>* **Higgs bosons** (spin 0) are massive scalear bosons with zero spin, even parity, no electric charge, and no color charge that interacts with mass.</small>
   
  <small>**Quantum statistics** describes particles in quatum mechanics. In quantum mechanics, unlike classical mechanics, particles of a particular type does not distinguish themselves from one another. = Interchaing any two particles in an ensemble of similar particles does not reconfigure the system. = The wave function of a system is invariant to the interchange of the constituent particles.</small>
  
  <small>**Spin** is a conserved quantity carried by elementary particles. Quantum mechanics has two types of angular momentum(각운동량): spin and orbital angular momentum. Angular momentum is the rotational analog of linear momentum -- it is a conserved quantity (which means the total angular momentum remains constant in a closed system) and it has a direction and a magnitude. Bicycles, motorcycles, and frisbees use the conservation of angular momentum to do what they do.</small>
<br/><br/>
* In the **grand unification epoch** (10<sup>-43</sup>s ~ 10<sup>-36</sup>s), the universe cools down to 10<sup>29</sup> kelvin. 
* The graviational force gets seperated from the unified force, and begins operating on the universe. 
* The unified force without the gravitational force gets stabilized into the electronuclear force. This is also called the grand unified force -- the name of the epoch.
* X and Y bosons (hypothetical elementary particles similar to the W and Z bosons) mediate the grand unified force, and this allows early matter to fluctuate between baryon and lepton states.
<br/><br/>
* At the end of the grand unification epoch, the strong force gets seperated from the grand unified force.
* It is conjectured that some part of this decay process violated the conservation of baryon number and gave rise to a small excess of matter over antimatter. This is called **baryogenesis**.
* This phase transition is thought to have triggered cosmic inflation that dominated the development of the universe during the following epoch.
<br/><br/>
* Now the **electroweak epoch** (10<sup>-36</sup>s ~ 10<sup>-12</sup>s), also called **inflationary epoch**. 
* At 10<sup>-36</sup>s: The universe cools down to 10<sup>28</sup> kelvin.
* As a result, the strong nuclear force gets seperated from the grand unified force, the rest forging into the electroweak force. (This may have fuelled the inflation of the universe.)
* As X and Y bosons decay, the elementary particles -- W and Z bosons, Higgs bosons are born.  
* At 10<sup>-33</sup>s ~ 10<sup>-32</sup>s: Inflation. Space expands by a factor of 10<sup>26</sup>. The universe supercools down to 10<sup>22</sup> kelvin.
* At 10<sup>-32</sup>s: Inflation ends. The familiar elementary paricles now form as a soup of hot ionized gas called quark-gluon plasma. 
<br/><br/>
* Phase trasition (10<sup>-12</sup>s): The forces are sepearated into the four fundamental interactions that we have now. As the weak nuclear force and electromagnetic force are separted, weak nuclear force now works at short-range, so matter particles can acquire mass and interact with the Higgs Field. The universe cools to 10<sup>15</sup> kelvin.
<br/><br/>
* Then the **quark epoch**. (10<sup>-12</sup>s ~ 10<sup>-5</sup>s).
* The four fundamental forces are now operating, but it is still to hot for quarks to unify into hadrons. Quark-gluon plasma exists. The universe coold down to 10<sup>15</sup> kelvin.
* At 10<sup>-11</sup>s: **Baryogenesis** could have happened here.
<br/><br/>
* Then the **hadron epoch**, the **lepton epoch**, the **photon epoch** take place (10<sup>-5</sup>s ~ 20min).
* As the universe cools down to 4000 kelvin: 
  * Quarks are bound into hadrons, protons and neutrons. 
  * Hadrons and antihadrons annihilate each other and leave behind leptons and antileptons.
  * Leptons and antileptons annihilate eache other. Electrons and positrons annihilate each other and leave behind some unmatched electrons.
  * Protons and neutrons are bound into primordial atomic nuclei (nucleosynthesis) which are hydrogen and helium-4, and 
  * Eventually the plasma of nuclei, electrons and photons are left to existence.
* Now 20 minutes have passed since big bang. Nuclear fusion stops happening, and normal matter are now comprised of 75% hydrogen nuclei and 25% helium nuclei. Free electrons begin scattering light. 

# Matter era (1800yrs ~ 9.13 billion yrs)
* 47,000 yrs: Matter and radiation become equivalent.
* 70,000 yrs: As the Jeasns length* drops, matter prevails in the universe. 

  <small>*The length at which the smallest structure can form.</small>

## Cosmic Dark Age
* 370,000 yrs: Electrons and protons first become bound to form electrically neutral hydrogen atoms.
* 200-300 million yrs: First stars begin to shine. 
* 400 million yrs: The oldest-known galaxy GN-z11 forms.
* 5 billion years: The thin disk of milky way began to form.

# Epochs of the formation of the Solar System
* 9.2 billion years: Triggered by primal supernova, the solar system forms.
* 9.2318 billion years: Sun forms.
* 9.257 billion years: Earth starts evolving around the sun.
* 10.4 billion years: The earlies traces of **life** on Earth emerges.
  * The natural process of life arising from non-living matter is called **abiogenesis**.
<br/><br/>
* Now, it's 13.8 billion years from big bang.
