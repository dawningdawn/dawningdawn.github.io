* In the beginning, there was _something_. That _something_ was the initial singularity*. 
* It contained all the energy and spacetime** of the Universe. 
* At least that's what some models of the Big Bang theory predicts to have existed before the Big Bang.

  <small>*Usually, singularity refers to a condition where gravity is so strong that spacetime breaks down. 
  Singularity is still poorly-defined, even according to the current best theory of gravity, the theory of general relativity. 
  General relativity predicts that any object that goes through gravitational collapse beyond a certain point, forms a black hole inside which singularity is formed. 
  However, initial singularity did not collapse into a black hole, because the spacetime was rapidly expanding. 
  (Currently-known density limits for gravitational collapse are based on objects of relatively constant size in time.)</small>

  <small>**Unlike energy that can be tranformed into matter, spacetime is not a physical object, but a mathematical model. (This does not mean it is not _real_.)
  It is a four-dimensional manifold that has the three dimensions of space and one dimension of time. 
  It’s also a differentiable manifold with a pseudo-Riemannian metric.</small>

# The First 20 Minutes

The instant immediately following the initial singularity is the infamous Big Bang, and the **Plank epoch** (0s ~ 10<sup>-43</sup>s). 
Then, the gravitational force and the unified force (electromagnetic force, weak force, strong force) were all one.
In the **grand unification epoch** (10<sup>-43</sup>s ~ 10<sup>-36</sup>s), graviational force gets seperated from the unified force. 
There is still no matter in this stage. So no mass, charge, flavor, or color change.

| What      | Follows         |
|-----------|-----------------|
| A table   | A Heading        |
| A table   | A Heading        |
| A table   | A Heading        |

----------------

There's a horizontal rule above and below this.

----------------

Here is an unordered list:

* Salt-n-Pepa
* Bel Biv DeVoe
* Kid 'N Play

And an ordered list:

1. Michael Jackson
2. Michael Bolton
3. Michael Bublé

And a nested list:

* Jackson 5
  * Michael
  * Tito
  * Jackie
  * Marlon
  * Jermaine
* TMNT
  * Leonardo
  * Michelangelo
  * Donatello
  * Raphael

Definition lists can be used with HTML syntax. Definition terms are bold and italic.

Tables should have bold headings and alternating shaded rows.

| Artist            | Album           | Year |
|-------------------|-----------------|------|
| Michael Jackson   | Thriller        | 1982 |
| Prince            | Purple Rain     | 1984 |
| Beastie Boys      | License to Ill  | 1986 |

If a table is too wide, it should condense down and/or scroll horizontally.

| Artist            | Album           | Year | Label       | Awards   | Songs     |
|-------------------|-----------------|------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| Michael Jackson   | Thriller        | 1982 | Epic Records | Grammy Award for Album of the Year, American Music Award for Favorite Pop/Rock Album, American Music Award for Favorite Soul/R&B Album, Brit Award for Best Selling Album, Grammy Award for Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical | Wanna Be Startin' Somethin', Baby Be Mine, The Girl Is Mine, Thriller, Beat It, Billie Jean, Human Nature, P.Y.T.

----------------

Code snippets like `var foo = "bar";` can be shown inline.

Also, `this should vertically align` ~~`with this`~~ ~~and this~~.

Code can also be shown in a block element.
````
var foo = "bar";
````

Code can also use syntax highlighting.
````Javascript
var foo = "bar";
````

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
```

```Javascript
var foo = "The same thing is true for code with syntax highlighting. A single line of code should horizontally scroll if it is really long.";
```

Inline code inside table cells should still be distinguishable.

| Language    | Code               |
|-------------|--------------------|
| Javascript  | `var foo = "bar";` |
| Ruby        | `foo = "bar"`      |

----------------

Small images should be shown at their actual size.

![](http://placekitten.com/g/300/200/)

Large images should always scale down and fit in the content container.

![](http://placekitten.com/g/1200/800/)

```
This is the final element on the page and there should be no margin below this.
```
