* In the beginning, there was _a primeval state_*. 
* And out of that state developed spacetime**.
* Now we have the initial singularity*** -- a hot, dense state that contained all the energy and spacetime of the Universe. 
  
  At least that's what some models of the Big Bang theory predicts to have existed before the Big Bang.

  <small>*Accodring to a qunatum theory of gravity of "Theory of Everything", it could have been a virtual particle (a theoretical transient particle that exhibits some of the characteristics of an ordinary particle, while having its existence limited by the uncertainty principle, and always conserves energy and momentum) or false vaccuum (a hypothetical vacuum that is stable, but not in the most stable state possible, and exists at a local minimum of energy). But who knows.</small>
  
  <small>**Unlike energy that can be tranformed into matter, spacetime is not a physical object, but a mathematical model. (This does not mean it is not _real_.) It is a four-dimensional manifold that has the three dimensions of space and one dimension of time. It’s also a differentiable manifold with a pseudo-Riemannian metric.</small>
  
  <small>***Usually, singularity refers to a condition where gravity is so strong that spacetime breaks down. (However, note that singularity is still poorly-defined, even according to the current best theory of gravity, the theory of general relativity.) 
  <br>General relativity predicts that any object that goes through gravitational collapse beyond a certain point, forms a black hole inside which singularity is formed. 
  <br>However, initial singularity did not collapse into a black hole, because the spacetime was rapidly expanding. 
  (Currently-known density limits for gravitational collapse are based on objects of relatively constant size in time.)</small>

# The First 20 Minutes

* Then an _event*_ happended to expand our initial singularity. Big Bang! 
* Immediately after the bang followed the **Plank epoch** (0s ~ 10<sup>-43</sup>s). 
* Back then, the gravitational force and the unified force (electromagnetic force, weak force, strong force) were all one.
* As our baby universe expands, it cools.

  <small>*It is all a conjecture, but WIMPS(Weakly Interacting Massive Particles) or dark matter & dark energy may have appeared to trigger the expansion of the initial singularity.</small> 

<br>* In the **grand unification epoch** (10<sup>-43</sup>s ~ 10<sup>-36</sup>s), the universe cools down to 10<sup>29</sup> kelvin. 
* The graviational force gets seperated from the unified force, and begins operating on the universe. 
* The unified force without the gravitational force gets stabilized into the electronuclear force. This is also called the grand unified force. 
* X and Y bosons (hypothetical elementary particles analagous to the W and Z bosons) mediate the grand unified force, and this allows early matter that fluctuate between baryon and lepton states.

<br>* At the end of the grand unification epoch, the strong force gets seperated from the grand unified force.
* It is conjectured that some part of this decay process violated the conservation of baryon number and gave rise to a small excess of matter over antimatter. This is called **baryogenesis**.
* This phase transition is thought to have triggered cosmic inflation that dominated the development of the universe during the following epoch.

<br>* Now the **electroweak epoch** (10<sup>-36</sup>s ~ 10<sup>-12</sup>s). 
* 10<sup>-36</sup>s: The universe cools down to 10<sup>28</sup> kelvin.
* As a result, the strong nuclear force gets seperated from the grand unified force, the rest forging into the electroweak force. (This may have fuelled the inflation of the universe.)
* As X and Y bosons decay, the elementary particles -- W and Z bosons, Higgs bosons are born.  
* 10<sup>-33</sup>s ~ 10<sup>-32</sup>s: Inflation. Space expands by a factor of 10<sup>26</sup>. The universe supercools down to 10<sup>22</sup> kelvin.
* 10<sup>-32</sup>s: Inflation ends. The familiar elementary paricles now form as a soup of hot ionized gas called quark-gluon plasma. 
  
<br>* Phase trasition (10<sup>-12</sup>s): The four fundamental interactions familiar from the modern universe now operate as distinct forces. The weak nuclear force is now a short-range force as it separates from electromagnetic force, so matter particles can acquire mass and interact with the Higgs Field. The universe cools to 10<sup>15</sup>.

<br>* Then the **quark epoch**. (10<sup>-12</sup>s ~ 10<sup>-5</sup>s).
* The f

Tables should have bold headings and alternating shaded rows.

| Artist            | Album           | Year |
|-------------------|-----------------|------|
| Michael Jackson   | Thriller        | 1982 |

| Beastie Boys      | License to Ill  | 1986 |

If a table is too wide, it should condense down and/or scroll horizontally.

----------------

Code snippets like `var foo = "bar";` can be shown inline.

Also, `this should vertically align` ~~`with this`~~ ~~and this~~.

Code can also be shown in a block element.
````
var foo = "bar";
````

Code can also use syntax highlighting.
````Javascript
var foo = "bar";
````

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
```

```Javascript
var foo = "The same thing is true for code with syntax highlighting. A single line of code should horizontally scroll if it is really long.";
```

Inline code inside table cells should still be distinguishable.

| Language    | Code               |
|-------------|--------------------|
| Javascript  | `var foo = "bar";` |
| Ruby        | `foo = "bar"`      |

----------------

Small images should be shown at their actual size.

![](http://placekitten.com/g/300/200/)

Large images should always scale down and fit in the content container.

![](http://placekitten.com/g/1200/800/)

```
This is the final element on the page and there should be no margin below this.
