* Sequence transduction models are the models that transduce sequences.
* What is transduction? Transduction is “deriving the values of the unknown function for points of interest from the given data” whcih could be understood as “moving from the particular to the particular.” [1]
* Hence, sequence transduction models are essentially trying to predict sequential data points from sequential data points, which presumably belong to the art same unknown function.
* The authors say that “dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex RNNs or CNNS that include an encoder and a decoder” and “the best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism.”
* By this, we can assume that a successful attention model requires an encoder and decoder connected through an attention mechanism.
* Possilby inspired by the trend, the authors propose a new **network architecture** “Transformer” which is “based soley on attention mechanisms” without recurrence and convolutions.
* Below are the advertised advantages evidenced by the results of experimets on two machine learning translation.

| Advantages      |
|-----------|
| Superior in quality   |
| More parallelizable   |
| Requiring significantly less time to train   |

| Experiments on machine learning translation | Results | Training Conditions | Note |
|-------------------|-----------------|------|------|
| WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task | 28.4 BLEU | ? | Improves over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU |
| WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task | 41.0 BLEU | 3.5 days on eight GPUs | Small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature |

Let's have a look ate the model architecture.

* Encoder
    * Takes as input a sequence of symbol representations ($x_1, ..., x_n)$ and map it onto a seqeunce of continuous representations $z=(z_1,...,z_n)$.

| What      | Follows         |
|-----------|-----------------|
| A table   | A Heading        |
| A table   | A Heading        |
| A table   | A Heading        |

----------------

There's a horizontal rule above and below this.

----------------

Here is an unordered list:

* Salt-n-Pepa
* Bel Biv DeVoe
* Kid 'N Play

And an ordered list:

1. Michael Jackson
2. Michael Bolton
3. Michael Bublé

And a nested list:

* Jackson 5
  * Michael
  * Tito
  * Jackie
  * Marlon
  * Jermaine
* TMNT
  * Leonardo
  * Michelangelo
  * Donatello
  * Raphael

Definition lists can be used with HTML syntax. Definition terms are bold and italic.

<dl>
    <dt>Name</dt>
    <dd>Godzilla</dd>
    <dt>Born</dt>
    <dd>1952</dd>
    <dt>Birthplace</dt>
    <dd>Japan</dd>

Tables should have bold headings and alternating shaded rows.

| Artist            | Album           | Year |
|-------------------|-----------------|------|
| Michael Jackson   | Thriller        | 1982 |
| Prince            | Purple Rain     | 1984 |
| Beastie Boys      | License to Ill  | 1986 |

If a table is too wide, it should condense down and/or scroll horizontally.

| Artist            | Album           | Year | Label       | Awards   | Songs     |
|-------------------|-----------------|------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| Michael Jackson   | Thriller        | 1982 | Epic Records | Grammy Award for Album of the Year, American Music Award for Favorite Pop/Rock Album, American Music Award for Favorite Soul/R&B Album, Brit Award for Best Selling Album, Grammy Award for Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical | Wanna Be Startin' Somethin', Baby Be Mine, The Girl Is Mine, Thriller, Beat It, Billie Jean, Human Nature, P.Y.T.

----------------

Code snippets like `var foo = "bar";` can be shown inline.

Also, `this should vertically align` ~~`with this`~~ ~~and this~~.

Code can also be shown in a block element.
````
var foo = "bar";
````

Code can also use syntax highlighting.
````Javascript
var foo = "bar";
````

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
```

```Javascript
var foo = "The same thing is true for code with syntax highlighting. A single line of code should horizontally scroll if it is really long.";
```

Inline code inside table cells should still be distinguishable.

| Language    | Code               |
|-------------|--------------------|
| Javascript  | `var foo = "bar";` |
| Ruby        | `foo = "bar"`      |

----------------

Small images should be shown at their actual size.

![](http://placekitten.com/g/300/200/)

Large images should always scale down and fit in the content container.

![](http://placekitten.com/g/1200/800/)

```
This is the final element on the page and there should be no margin below this.
```
